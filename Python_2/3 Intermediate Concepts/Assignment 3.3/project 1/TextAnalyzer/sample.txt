Absolutely! Here are four detailed intermediate Python assignments tailored to reinforce your understanding of functions, modules, standard library, functional programming, and more — just like your Smart File Manager CLI tool:

📦 Project 1: Text File Analyzer CLI
🧠 Concepts: Functions, *args/**kwargs, standard library, argparse, modules
🎯 Goal: Create a CLI tool that analyzes a .txt file and reports stats like word count, line count, most frequent words, etc.
✅ What to Do:
	• Input: A .txt file path from the command line.
	• Output: Display total words, lines, characters, and top 5 most common words.
📂 Suggested Structure:
textanalyzer/
├── main.py
├── analyzer.py
└── utils.py
📌 Expected Output:
$ python main.py analyze --file sample.txt
Lines: 42
Words: 523
Characters: 3120
Top 5 Words:
1. the (50x)
2. and (30x)
...

🗂️ Project 2: JSON Data Cleaner
🧠 Concepts: Dictionary handling, modules, exception handling, lambda, map/filter
🎯 Goal: Process a JSON file (list of dictionaries) and clean/format its values.
✅ What to Do:
	• Input: JSON file with user profiles (e.g., name, age, email, is_active).
	• Clean tasks:
		○ Capitalize names.
		○ Remove inactive users.
		○ Ensure emails are lowercase.
📂 Suggested Structure:
jsoncleaner/
├── main.py
├── cleaner.py
└── helpers.py
📌 Expected Output:
$ python main.py clean --file users.json
✅ Cleaned 10 users.
❌ Removed 2 inactive profiles.

📊 Project 3: Expense Tracker (CSV)
🧠 Concepts: File I/O, standard library (csv, datetime), map/reduce, lambda
🎯 Goal: Track and summarize expenses saved in a .csv file.
✅ What to Do:
	• Input: CSV file with format Date, Category, Amount.
	• Output:
		○ Total spent per category.
		○ Highest and lowest expenses.
		○ Total spending this month.
📂 Suggested Structure:
expensetracker/
├── main.py
├── parser.py
└── summary.py
📌 Expected Output:
$ python main.py report --file expenses.csv
Total this month: ₱12,300
Top Category: Food (₱5,400)
Biggest Expense: ₱2,000 on 2025-05-15

🧠 Project 4: Quiz Game Generator
🧠 Concepts: Classes, JSON, random, custom modules, functions
🎯 Goal: Create a quiz app that pulls questions from a JSON file and scores the user.
✅ What to Do:
	• Input: JSON file with question, options, correct_answer.
	• Show 5 random questions.
	• Score and give results at the end.
📂 Suggested Structure:
quizgame/
├── main.py
├── game.py
└── question_loader.py
📌 Expected Output:
Question 1: What is the capital of France?
a) Rome  b) Berlin  c) Paris  d) Madrid
Your answer: c
...
