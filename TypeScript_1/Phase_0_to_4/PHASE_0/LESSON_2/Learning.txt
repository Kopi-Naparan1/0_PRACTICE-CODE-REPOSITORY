type vs interface

| Feature              | `interface`         | `type`                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Extending objects    | ✅ Easy (`extends`)  | ✅ With intersection (`&`)          |
| Merging declarations | ✅ YES (auto-merges) | ❌ No (error on redefinition)       |
| Union or tuple types | ❌ Not allowed       | ✅ YES                              |
| Preferred for...     | Objects, classes    | Primitives, unions, advanced types |


Use interface for object-like structures

Use type when:

You need unions ("admin" | "user")

You want to combine multiple types

You're not working with class-based systems
